# SoundDelay
A prototype of my [SoundDelay](https://sound-delay.vercel.app/) project, using Streamlit. See the [final project](https://sound-delay.vercel.app/), and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hcussen/SoundDelay). 

To calculate timing delay on a marching band field.
A quick streamlit demo to show the timing adjustment needed, given the box position, drumline position, and hornline position.
